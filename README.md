# interfacing-to-hospital-equipment
Solutions for enabling extended control of various hospital instruments for access from outside patient's rooms.

# Problem
Hospitals dealing with COVID-19 patients have an array of instrumentation that are needed in close proximity to each patient. These instruments often have alarms that need to be silenced, or settings that need to be changed which requires the simple push of a button. To push this button, medical workers have to put on all new PPE, go in the room, push the button, leave and dispose of the PPE. This creates risk to the medical worker, and wastes PPE all for a relatively trival task. Doctors and nurses are complaining that this is a huge issue.

# Solution
Determine ways to bring the controls of these instruments out of the rooms, where the medical workers can access them far from the patient. This could include extending tubing/wiring for systems where this is an option, or developing interfaces to remote-control ports on these devices. It appears that while some systems have these ports for extending control, the actual hardware to connect to them is for some reason unavailable.

# Risks
Due to the rapid need for these enhancements, testing on actual hardware will be limited, and in no way meet the usual requirements for the healthcare industry. While these risks are probably unacceptable for some instruments, for others it might be worth the risk to reduce exposure to our most important workers. Here we are only trying to provide doctors with more options.

# What needs to be done?
- Determine what hardware is in need for these modifications (PROVIDERS: please see the [wiki](https://github.com/maxroberts/interfacing-to-hospital-equipment/wiki)!)
- Acquire user manuals and service manuals for these instruments
- Conceptualize a solution
- Reach out to the medical device manufactures for their input on how best to implement these adaptations
- Prototype something
- Reach out to doctors/hospitals for equipment that could be used for testing (disfunctional, excess)
