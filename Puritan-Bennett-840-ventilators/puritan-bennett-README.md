# Puritan-Bennett 840 Ventilators
This is a common ventilator. Add more basic details here.

# Notes
 - Technical reference manual looks to have super promising material on RS-232 in on pg 14
 - Ch 19 of the same document describes the RS-232 commands. There are only 3 commands and non specifically reset the alarms.
 - Is resetting the alarms what we actually want to be able to do? Ie, press the "Alarm reset key" documented on page OP 1-12 as:
> Alarm reset key: Clears active alarms or resets high-urgency alarms 
> and cancels an active alarm silence, and is recorded in the alarm 
> log. Each time you press the reset key, it is recorded in the alarm 
> log, if there is an active alarm. You cannot reset a DEVICE ALERT 
> alarm.
